title: Broken resolv.conf symlink crashes Shoes applications
desc: |-
  Config.parse_resolv_conf returns a nil if /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to a non-existent file. This occurs on OS X when it is not attached to any network.
  
  So, then, lazy_initialize falls over on line 794, because config_hash is nil, and crashes any Shoe app trying to run.
